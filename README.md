2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   Answer:

    - Here are the steps to install Python on Windows:

     Download Python:
   
      - Visit the Python Releases for Windows page.
      - Choose the latest version (e.g., Python 3.12.4) compatible with your system architecture (64-bit or ARM64).
      - Download the Windows installer.
        
     Run the Installer:
   
      - Double-click the downloaded installer.
      - Check the box to add Python to PATH during installation (recommended).
      - Click “Install Now.”
        
    Customize Installation (Optional):

      - You can customize the installation by selecting additional features or adjusting settings.
      - For most users, the default options are sufficient.
        
    Verify Installation:

      - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
      - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
      - You should see the installed Python version (e.g., “Python 3.12.4”).
      - 
   Set Up a Virtual Environment :

      - Install the virtualenv package (if not already installed):
         
        `pip install virtualenv` 
       

        Create a new virtual environment:
        
      - `python -m venv myenv`

   Activate the virtual environment:

    - Command Prompt: `myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

     Answers:

       This program prints Hello, world!
       print('Hello, world!')
     - We use the built-in print() function to display the string “Hello, world!” on the screen.

5. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Answers:

   - Text Type (str): Represents textual data, such as words or sentences.
     
Numeric Types:

   - int: Used for whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).
     - float: Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
     - complex: Handles complex numbers (e.g., 2 + 3j).
       
Sequence Types:

   - list: An ordered collection of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
   - tuple: Similar to a list but immutable (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
   - range: Represents a sequence of numbers (e.g.,` range(5)`).
     
Mapping Type:

 - dict: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., {`name: "John", "age": 30 `}).

examples :

  - Example script:
    
      `text_variable = "Hello, world!"`
      `print(text_variable)`
  
       `integer_variable = 42`
     `print(integer_variable)`
  
       `float_variable = 3.14`
       `print(float_variable)`
  
    `boolean_variable = True`
    `print(boolean_variable)`
  
    `list_variable = [1, 2, 3]`
   `print(list_variable)`
  
    ` dictionary_variable = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`
     `print(dictionary_variable)`

6. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

 Answers:
    if (condition):
      - Executes this block if
      - condition is true
    else:
      - Executes this block if
      - condition is false
      
  Example of if else :
  
    `  x = 3 `
  ` if x == 4: `
  `  print("Yes") `
   `else: `
    `print("No")`
  

7. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

8. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

9. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

10. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

11. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Answers:

  1. Open the File: Use the `open()` function to open the file. Specify the file name and the mode (e.g., "r" for read mode).
  -  For example:
        - `with open("myfile.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()`
  2. Read the Content: The `read() `method reads the entire content of the file into a string (data in the example above).
  Close the File: The `with` statement automatically closes the file when you’re done.

  - Here’s a simple example:

    -   `with open("myfile.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)`
  3. Writing to a File
  To write data to a file, follow these steps:

   - Open the File: Use the open() function with write mode ("w") to open the file.
      - For example:
