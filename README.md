# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Answer:

   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language
     
 Python key features:
 
   - Easy to Learn and Use: Simple syntax that mimics natural language.
     
   - Interpreted Language: Executes code line by line, which makes debugging easier.
     
   - Versatile and Powerful: Supports various programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
     
   - Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Access to a wide range of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Django, Flask, etc.
     
   - Community Support: Large and active community

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   Answer:

    - Here are the steps to install Python on Windows:

     Download Python:
   
      - Visit the Python Releases for Windows page.
      - Choose the latest version (e.g., Python 3.12.4) compatible with your system architecture (64-bit or ARM64).
      - Download the Windows installer.
        
     Run the Installer:
   
      - Double-click the downloaded installer.
      - Check the box to add Python to PATH during installation (recommended).
      - Click “Install Now.”
        
    Customize Installation (Optional):

      - You can customize the installation by selecting additional features or adjusting settings.
      - For most users, the default options are sufficient.
        
    Verify Installation:

      - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
      - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
      - You should see the installed Python version (e.g., “Python 3.12.4”).
      - 
   Set Up a Virtual Environment :

      - Install the virtualenv package (if not already installed):
         
        `pip install virtualenv` 
       

        Create a new virtual environment:
        
      - `python -m venv myenv`

   Activate the virtual environment:

    - Command Prompt: `myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

5. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

6. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

 Answers:

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
